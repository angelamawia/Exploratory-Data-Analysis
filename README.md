# Malaria Cases in Kenya: Comprehensive Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of malaria cases in Kenya, using historical data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The analysis covers various aspects, including regional differences, seasonal variations, and overall trends in malaria cases across multiple counties in Kenya. The goal is to provide actionable insights to inform health policy and intervention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `malaria_cases.csv` and contains the following columns:
- `county`: The county in Kenya where malaria cases were recorded.
- `year`: The year in which the data was recorded.
- `month`: The month in which malaria cases were reported.
- `value`: The number of reported malaria cases.

## Key Objectives
- **Trend Analysis**: Investigate malaria trends over the years.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Understand how malaria cases fluctuate throughout different months and seasons.
- **Regional Impact**: Compare malaria cases across various counties in Kenya.
- **Public Health Insights**: Provide insights to guide malaria prevention and control efforts.

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing or inconsistent data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore key trends and patterns.
3. **Visualization**: Use time series plots, heat maps, and bar charts to highlight trends.
4. **Insights**: Highlight findings, such as seasonal peaks and regional hot spots.

## Key Findings
- **Seasonal Variation**: Malaria cases peak during specific months, indicating strong seasonal effects.
- **Regional Differences**: Counties in the western and coastal regions have higher malaria incidences.
- **Yearly Trends**: Some regions show a decrease in malaria cases, while others fluctuate.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Step-by-step documentation of the analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Charts created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malaria-analysis-kenya.git

## Project Background
This analysis was part of a data science Workshop consisting of a seminar and hackathon organized by the Department of Computing and Informatics (DCI), the Center for Health Informatics and Digital Health (CHIDH) and Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA). . The hackathon aimed to solve real-world problems using data analytics. Our team's focus was on analyzing malaria cases in Kenya to gain insights into patterns and trends that could inform better health policies and interventions.

## Future Work
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a model to predict future malaria cases.
- **Climate Data Integration**: Analyze how climate factors affect malaria transmission.
- **Intervention Mapping**: Identify regions needing more intervention efforts.
